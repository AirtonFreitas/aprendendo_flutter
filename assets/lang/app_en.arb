  "introduction": "For the information below, I am assuming that you already know how an algorithm works and you already have knowledge in programming logic.",
  "dartDescription": "Dart is a strongly typed programming language initially created by Google in 2011. Dart's initial mission was to replace JavaScript for scripting web pages.",
  "dartEvolution": "However, with the evolution of the language and over the years, it can now be considered a multi-paradigm language, although the language has strong structures typical of object-oriented languages.\nI'm going to show you some of the dart syntax.",
  "firstSee": "First let's see what a simple 'Hello World' would look like in dart.",
  "variables": "Variables",
  "variablesCreate": "You can create a variable without declaring the exact type of the variable. But the type of the variable is inferred the moment you declare a value for the variable.",
  "variableDynamic": "So the 'var' type remains as dynamic if a value is not defined for the variable. \n 'After the definition of some value for variable it has the inferred type.'\n ' And after that we can 't change the type of the variable.",
  "variableCreateType": "And you can also create the variable by declaring the format directly:",
  "rememberingVariable": "Remembering that it is not possible to change the format of the variable.",
  "variablesConst": "Constant Variables",
  "variablesConstCreate": "To declare a constant variable, just use the word 'final' instead of 'var'.",
  "ifAndElseTitle": "If and Else",
  "ifAndElseExample": "For the example below, if the balance is greater than or equal to the Withdrawal amount, it will allow to withdraw. Otherwise, the system will not withdraw.",
  "ifAndElseConditions": "Between the parentheses we have the IF condition, if it meets the conditions the code inside the braces will be executed. If it doesn't meet the conditions, the code inside the ELSE braces will be executed.",
  "forTitle": "For",
  "forExample": "For the FOR loop example, we will count the numbers until we reach the number 10.",
  "forDescription": "As we know, the for loop consists of executing an action a certain number of times. And inside the parentheses() we have 3 parameters. ",

  "switchTitle": "Switch",
  "switchDescription": "The Switch command has the function of executing a certain code when it meets a specific condition. '\n 'And it is usually used when we have several possible options.",

  "switchAC": "'AC Tax is 17%'",
  "switchAL": "'AL Tax is 12%'",
  "switchRJ": "'RJ Tax is 18%'",
  "switchSC": "'SC Tax is 17%'",
  "switchDefault": "'Sale unavailable for your state.'",
  "switchExample": "For example in this example above, the Switch is testing which STATUS is being informed. '\n 'If it is one of the examples, it will print exactly the aliquot. '\n 'But if the state is unknown, it will enter the DEFAULT option and it will display the message that the sale is unavailable."
